+ <code>NullPointer</code> is a simple cheat for CS2 
+ <code>external</code> it doesn't inject in the proccess
+ <code>open source</code> you can use it freely
+ <code>read/write modes</code> the application **DOESN'T** read only!
+ <code>kernel</code> uses the driver to communicate with the process memory
+ <code>FULL C-BASED</code> it's the perfect reason for educational purposes, isn't it?
